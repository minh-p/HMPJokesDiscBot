* HMPJokesDiscBot
A discord bot that generates offensive jokes every single day in a discord channel. For fun!!!
** Design Document.
- Each day, at 12:00am, there will be an asian generated in #HMP-Offensive-Jokes.
    - It will be just jokes (words).
- This is going to be a simple bot.
*** Jokes API
- [[https://v2.jokeapi.dev/][Jokes API]]
- I am going to start to read this.
- I found a [[https://github.com/leet-hakker/JokeAPI-Python#readme][wrapper for Python]].
**** The Wrapper
- It looks like the wrapper, uses the async block. I am going to have to learn that. It's just a special python function from the module asyncio.
- I have to understand as much as possible about the code before I write any.
- Jokes API v2 also came with a separate module.
**** Some other things I would have/like to implement
- Sometimes, the same joke would repeat twice or more.
    - So, it would be nice if there was as command to generate a new joke on request.
*** Discord API
**** Crucial Functionalities
- I need the bot to be able to read the commands.
    - That should be easy, just look in any discord bot's repo as reference.
- I also need the bot to write the joke whenever there is a command.
- I am going to use a separate channel for the bot itself.
*** Misc
- I have let to figure out a way to run the discord bot and check until the specific time then to input the joke in the server.
